# Peer Review

## Provided Potential Improvements
1. The default coefficient of "2" in the element_coefficient block may benefit from being more flexible, allowing users to start with different coefficients.
2. Consider adding alt attributes to images for improved accessibility.
3. Implement error handling, particularly for file downloads, to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
4. Enhance maintainability by adding comments to the CSS code, explaining the purpose of each style rule.
5. Consider implementing â€˜hoverand: active` states for interactive elements to provide user feedback.
6. Additional blocks or custom field configurations can be included in the toolbox depending on project requirements.
7. Consider adding tooltips or help URLs to individual block definitions within the XML for enhanced user guidance.
8. As the project evolves, additional block types can be added to cater to more complex chemical equations.
9. Custom field options or additional configurations can be integrated into this XML file if needed.

## Adjustments Made Based on Provided Input
1. Users can already change the coefficient in the coefficient blocks so the block was left unchanged.
2. The images for the equation block representing the forward and two-way reactions were not loading properly in some browsers so they were replaced with ASCII representations of those symbols
3. Error handling was added for functional blocks as well as a check for valid elements in the molar mass block to give feedback to the user if they created an invalid element.
4. Current and new additions to the CSS file had comments added and included to state what the purpose of each line was.
5. Tooltips were added to the blocks so users would be able to understand what each block was for but hover and active states were not added after doing research into the hover state. Due to the lack of detectability of a hover state on mobile devices and the prominence of mobile-first development, hover states were found to be declining in popularity.
6. The toolbox and workspace xml files were removed because they were redundant. The blocks were already being injected into the workspace and defined in the index.html file.
7. See 6.
8. The focus of future project development was to add more function blocks that allowed for more analysis of equations. Common compounds were prebuilt to allow for quicker construction of complex chemical equations while also reducing the size of the blocks for complex compounds that used common compounds.
9. See 6.
