**Motivation**
A crucial element in both chemistry research and education lies in the ability to comprehend and communicate the interactions among molecules of various elements. When examining a chemical equation, one can verify its balance, compute the reaction stoichiometry, and dissect the equation into partial reactions. Although chemical equations offer numerous intriguing possibilities, including visualizations, our group is currently exploring the development of a chemistry Domain-Specific Language (DSL). This DSL would initially concentrate on inputs and operations related to chemical equations.

**Functionality, with links to documentation**
This project was created in Blockly. In this Blockly-based interface, users are able to snap blocks representing chemical elements and compounds together to create chemical equations. Just as the elements serve as the building blocks of chemistry, elements serve as the building blocks for this project. Chemical equations are separated into a left-hand side to represent the reactants, and a right-hand side to represent the products. When the equation is built, the balance check block should be applied to ensure that the equation is valid. From the balanced state, other function blocks can be attached to perform different operations on the blocks.
